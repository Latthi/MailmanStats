doc="""Attributes supported by this class are:
color(type:color.T) default=default.
    The color of the line.
    
width(type:number) default=0.4.
    Width of the line, in points.
    
dash(type:tuple) default=None.
    The value of None will draw a solid line. Otherwise, this
    attribute specifies the style of dashed lines.  The 2N'th value
    specifies the length of the line (in points), and 2N+1'th value
    specfies the length of the blank.
    
       For example, the dash style of (3,2,4,1) draws a dashed line
    that looks like `---__----_---__----_...'.
    
cap_style(type:int) default=0.
    Defines the style of the tip of the line segment.  0: butt cap
    (square cutoff, with no projection beyond), 1: round cap (arc),
    2: projecting square cap (square cutoff, but the line extends
    half the line width).  See also Postscript/PDF reference manual.
    
join_style(type:int) default=0.
    Join style. 0: Miter join (sharp, pointed corners), 1: round
    join (rounded corners), 2: bevel join (flattened corners).  See
    also Postscript/PDF reference manual.
